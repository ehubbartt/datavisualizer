          Let us begin with a normal Bianary Search Tree we learned <a
            href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3021/lessons/7191/slides/34500">in class</a>,
          where each node contain a <span class="orange">value</span>, and the nodes are linked with lesser values being
          left children, and greater values being right children. This structure works great with bianary
          search, as when it is properly made it allows for data to be found in Log(n) steps.

          These work great until you try to enter your data sequentially i.e. in acending or decending order.
          When this happens, the tree becomes very long, and you lose any advantages of a BST, as you will
          potentially have to traverse through <em>every</em> element.

          One approach to solve this problem is to add a second value to each node, a <span
            class="purple">priority</span>.
          The structure will still follow the BST rules with regard to the <span class="orange">value</span>,
          but it will also follow heap rules with regard to the <span class="purple">priority</span>, so
          nodes will always have a lower <span class="purple">priority</span> than any of its children.

          What we have created now is a combination of a <em>tree</em> and a <em>heap</em>, hence its name, a
          <strong>treap</strong>.
          These invariants are enforced anytime a new peice of data is added through a series of rotations,
          very similar to how an AVL tree works, as we learned <a
            href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3021/lessons/7200/slides/37543">here</a>.
          But how do we decide the <span class="purple">priorities</span> in order to make the tree more
          balanced? We do that <em>randomly</em>! The reason why we do this has to do with probability.
          A normal BST reaches its worse-case senario when data is inserted in order, but with these new invariants,
          both the data being entered, and the randomly assigned priority would have to be in sequential order,
          something that has a very low probability. What this means is that while there is still a chance we
          see the worse-case senario, the odds become very low. But even in that unlikely event, the structure
          has a chance to balance itself out whenever a new insertion is made!
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/treapRebalancing.png" alt="A Treap" class='diagram'>
        <p>
          But perhaps the best part about this approach is that because it still builds off all the invariants
          of a default BST tree, adding these new rules will only ever make the tree more bushy, it will never
          make it worse! As you hopefully can see, Treaps are able to build off the materials we learned in class,
          and use randomness in order to improve upon them.

        <h2>Skip Lists</h2>
        <p>
          For this data structure, we begin with the basic linked list, where every node contains a value,
          and it its child is the node with the next highest value. This data structure is great if we want
          to add a new peice of data, beacuse we would only have to change, at most, two connections, as we
          add the new node in the middle of this chain. The biggest problem with it, however, is that in order
          to find a node, we would first need to traverse through all the nodes before it, giving us a worse-case
          runtime of O(N).

        <p>
          But what if we add a new pointer, that points at a node in the middle of our chain, and marks what node
          it points at? Because the nodes are in order, we know that any value that is greater than our pointer
          is going to be after that node. Therefore, we can use this pointer to <em>skip</em> a portion of our linked
          list!
          In this case, we can compare the number we are looking for with 48. If it is greater, than we can start where
          the pointer is, without having to traverse through all the previous nodes!

          But we can take this concept even further, by adding more pointers throughout our data, and storing all these
          pointers in a parallel linked list! This gives us several spots where we can skip through our linked list,
          creating a <strong>Skip List</strong>!

          We can also depict this structure in the following way, where the rows in this grid represent each linked
          list.
          If a column has a box in that row, that means there is a pointer to that node in that skip list. The Skip List
          below is the same as the one above, notice how the nodes with pointers are taller than the others. It is also
          worth
          noting that any node in a linked list must be in the list below it.

    <section data-index="5">
      <div id="card">
        <p>
          However, we are not just limited to having one skip list, we can also create a skip list, for our skip list!
          This
          becomes very powerful as we work with larger and larger data sets, as each level allows us to skip lots of
          traversals
          on the level below.

          Finally, when we want to search for our data, we start with the highest skip tree, and traverse through it
          like
          normal
          until we reach our value, or we go too far. In the first case, we are all finished, but in the second,
          we need to go back one node, then down to our next skip list. We continue until we find our value, or pass it
          on
          the last level, in which case the data is not in the skip lists. In the visual below, we are looking for the
          node
          with the value of 51. The green arrows are where we traverse through a list, the red are where we went to far,
          and
          had to go back and down a level.

        <p>
          As for how we determain which level each node is on, we can once again use random probability! Whenever we
          add a new node, we start at the bottom level and give it a 50% chance of staying there, and 50% chance of
          moving up a level, coninuing until it stays on a level. This is able to distribute the nodes, so that each
          level has about 50% of the nodes below it, meaning that it skips the other 50% of nodes. So for example,
          below when we added the '48' node, it went through 3 random rolls before it stayed on a level, so it shows up
          in all 3 of our linked lists. The chance of it being added to just the bottom list was 50%, and the chance
          of it being added to the next list up was 50% of that, (25%). The full odds of each node being on the level it
          was is shown below.
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/skipListOdds.png" alt="A BST">
        <p>
          While each new node has the potential to be on a theoretically infinite number of skip lists, because of
          the decreasing probability of each level, it is more likely that the highest number of skip lists we will
          see is log(N). While the randomness of this structure doesn't make it perfect, it means that each skip List
          will be able to skip about half of the remaining entries. This is comparable to the BSTs we learned in class,
          where going to the left or right of a node eliminates half of the remaining possibilities. But these Skip
          Lists are still able to be easily added, only requiring you to change a few connections and make a few random
          rolls. This structure also dynamically resizes itself, as the more entries that are added, the more likely it
          is that we will see a node with a greater height, creating a new skip list. In this way, randomness can be
          used
          to create a very powerful data structure.

          For this last data structure, we need to revisit Skip Lists. Let's say you don't like linked lists,
          or you just want to work with trees. That is what a <strong>Zip Tree</strong> is, a skip list, in Tree
          form! To begin, let us look at a Skip List.

          When we convert this to a tree, we assign each node its normal value, plus a <span class="red">rank</span>,
          very similar to what we did with Treaps. This <span class="red">rank</span> is going to be equal to
          the corresponding 'height' on the Skip List, or equal to x number of successful 50% rolls. So for example,
          the '39' node had a height of 3 on the Skip List, therefore its <span class="red">rank</span> is 3. Then
          we just order the nodes like a normal BST, but with the added invariant that each node's <span
            class="red">rank</span>
          must be greater than it's left child, and equal to or greater than its right child. That's it!
        </p>
        <img src="imgs/zipTree.png" alt="A BST">

          The concept behind Zip Trees is very similar to Treaps. They take the existing BST structure, and use
          randomness
          to make the chance of the tree encountering its worse-case scenario very small. Also notice how the top-most
          nodes
          from the Skip Tree form a chain down the top of the Zip Tree, a hint of the correspondence between these
          structures,
          that we will explore more here. Again, while this does not guarentee the best-case scenario, because it still
          follows
          the BST invariants, it will almost always make the runtime better than a default BST.
