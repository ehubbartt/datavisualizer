            Throughout our time in this course, we have learned many data structures and algorithms that allow for quick and
            efficient storage and retrieval of information. But, one of the main issues that many beginner programmers face,
            ourselves included, is the ability to comprehend and create complex data structures. When we first started this class,
            it seemed there was no small amount of confusion around some structures, and it took a while for people to start
            understanding and grasping the concepts and implementations presented in class. Using randomized algorithms to create
            structures is, in our opinion, not just effective, as we will discuss later, but also easier to understand and to
            create. Creating weight based on randomness is a very simple thing to do that also creates a very balanced and efficient
            structure, reducing complexity tremendously. Learning about skip lists really fascinated us. Something about the
            flipping of the coin to determine height of skip lists seemed like such a simple but elegant solution to a very
            complicated problem, and we saw that it worked very well to bring down runtime. All these structures still are built on
            structures and techniques we learned in class, they are just able to implement randomness in order to expand and improve
            on them. In many cases, the end result is much more powerful, and even visually interesting.
