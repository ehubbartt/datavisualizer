          Let us begin with a normal Bianary Search Tree we learned <a
            href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3021/lessons/7191/slides/34500">in class</a>,
          where each node contain a <span class="orange">value</span>, and the nodes are linked with lesser values being
          left children, and greater values being right children. This structure works great with bianary
          search, as when it is properly made it allows for data to be found in Log(n) steps.
        </p>

        <p>
          These work great until you try to enter your data sequentially i.e. in acending or decending order.
          When this happens, the tree becomes very long, and you lose any advantages of a BST, as you will
          potentially have to traverse through <em>every</em> element.

      <div id="card">
        <img src="imgs/badBST.jpg" alt="A bad BST" class='diagram'>

        <p>
          One approach to solve this problem is to add a second value to each node, a <span
            class="purple">priority</span>.
          The structure will still follow the BST rules with regard to the <span class="orange">value</span>,
          but it will also follow heap rules with regard to the <span class="purple">priority</span>, so
          nodes will always have a lower <span class="purple">priority</span> than any of its children.
        </p>

        <p>
          What we have created now is a combination of a <em>tree</em> and a <em>heap</em>, hence its name, a
          <strong>treap</strong>.
          These invariants are enforced anytime a new peice of data is added through a series of rotations,
          very similar to how an AVL tree works, as we learned <a
            href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/3021/lessons/7200/slides/37543">here</a>.
          But how do we decide the <span class="purple">priorities</span> in order to make the tree more
          balanced? We do that <em>randomly</em>! The reason why we do this has to do with probability.
          A normal BST reaches its worse-case senario when data is inserted in order, but with these new invariants,
          both the data being entered, and the randomly assigned priority would have to be in sequential order,
          something that has a very low probability. What this means is that while there is still a chance we
          see the worse-case senario, the odds become very low. But even in that unlikely event, the structure
          has a chance to balance itself out whenever a new insertion is made!

        <img src="imgs/treapRebalancing.jpg" alt="A Treap" class='diagram'>

        <p>
          But perhaps the best part about this approach is that because it still builds off all the invariants
          of a default BST tree, adding these new rules will only ever make the tree more bushy, it will never
          make it worse! As you hopefully can see, Treaps are able to build off the materials we learned in class,
          and use randomness in order to improve upon them.
